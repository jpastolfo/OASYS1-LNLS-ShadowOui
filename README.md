# OASYS1-LNLS-ShadowOui
Widgets developed by the Brazilian Synchrotron Light Laboratory (LNLS) - Optics Group - with useful functions for OASYS1 

## Installation

The procedure recommended is to install this package in develop mode, which makes it easy to uninstall afterwards, if desired. Make sure to use the correct python3 - the procedure below will work for OASYS1 standard installation using miniconda at home directory.

```
git clone https://github.com/oasys-lnls-kit/OASYS1-LNLS-ShadowOui
cd OASYS1-LNLS-ShadowOui
~/miniconda3/bin/python3 setup.py develop
```

To uninstall it, simply run the command below and delete the folder.

```
~/miniconda3/bin/python3 setup.py develop --uninstall
```

## Widgets

### Flux Widget
The Flux widget calculates the total flux (in units of ph/s) and power (in Watts) after any ShadowOui optical element or at sample position. This is done by calculating the source spectrum and convolving with the beamline energy-dependent transmittance calculated with ShadowOui.

The Bending Magnet and Wiggler spectrum is calculated analytically as in [X-ray Data Booklet](http://xdb.lbl.gov/). The correct (not gaussian approximation) vertical angular distribution of the source is computed to account for partial acceptance of the vertical divergence. This enables optimization of the simulation when the beamline vertical acceptance is not total. 

The Linear Undulator (elliptical undulator is to be implemented soon) source spectrum is calculated numerically using [SRW](https://github.com/ochubar/SRW) (Synchrotron Radiation Workshop) code (see ref. [1]), taking into account the energy spread and finite emittance of the electron beam. SRW is natively shipped with OASYS1 and should be enabled.

### Examples 

See the [Examples Folder](examples) for a few examples and usage tips of the Flux Widget.

### User's Guideline

To use Flux Widget, just link the desired optical element (or source) widget to the Flux Widget and modify the parameters corresponding to the source.

**IMPORTANT NOTE 1**: Flux Widget calculates the beamline transmission using the **Begin.dat** file. Therefore, to use the Flux Widget, the user must enable writing the `Begin.dat` file in the ShadowOui source widget (such as Geometrical Source, Bending Magnet widgets). 
ALSO, THE USER MUST ALWAYS MAKE SURE THAT THE `Begin.dat` FILE IN THE WORKSPACE FOLDER INDEED CORRESPOND TO THE CURRENT SIMULATION! For instance, when there are more than one workspace in the same folder (or more than one source widget in the same workspace), it is possible that the Flux Widget gives very weird results (or even small deviations, which are harder to detect) due to use of an incorrect `Begin.dat` file generated by another simulation/configuration! 

To degub the results, all the intermediate steps of the calculation are shown in other tabs (Source Spectrum, Beamline Transmittance, Histogram, Source Acceptance and Output). As explained above, most errors are due to an old `Begin.dat` file being used, so please run the source widget again and check the results.

**IMPORTANT NOTE 2**: In `Calculation Settings` tab, the user must define the source vertical and horizontal acceptance range where the flux will be calculated. If `Calculate Acceptance from Source` checkbox is checked, which is the default, the source acceptance will be calculated internally, according to data generated by the Shadow's source. However, if the calculated acceptance does not fit the source divergence, the user can uncheck the box and insert more suitable acceptance values for the simulated setup. We encourage the user to insert these limits manually.
For example, the horizontal divergence distribution of a bending magnet source, which is constant, have smooth edges in Shadow beam. In this case, the divergence limits are usually larger than those defined by the user, and to increase the calculation accuracy, the user must define the (same) divergence limits also in the Flux Widget. Note that the user can always check the parameters used in flux calculation in the `Output` tab.
